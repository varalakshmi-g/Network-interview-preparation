# Network-interview-preparation
A collection of my learning notes, practice questions to prepare for network-related interviews and sharpening my knowledge on networking concepts.

Question 1:  What is Network? What are the types of network?

Ans: Network is a group of computers, servers, network devices which are connected together to share the data.

Types of network are:

1. PAN(Personal Area Network): PAN is the most basic type of computer network 
 1.LAN(Local Area Network): LAN is a privately owned computer network covering a small networks geographical area like a home, office, or groups of buildings. The size of LAN is usually small. The various devices in LAN are connected to central devices called HUB or switch using a cable.

2. WAN(Wide Area Network): A WAN is a telecommunication network. Simply WAN is network of networks. WANs connect LANs that may be on opposite sides of a building, across the country or around world. WANs are characterized by the slowest data communication rates and the largest distances. WANs are of two types, they are an Enterprise WAN and Global WAN. CComputers connected to a WAN are often connected through public networks such as telephonic system.

3. MAN(Metropolitan Area Networks): MAN is a new class of network. MAN is larger than a local area network and as its name implies, it covers the area of single city.MAN is rarely extend beyond 100 KM  and frequently comprise a combination of different hardware and transmission media. It is a means of connecting a number of LANs into a larger network so that resources can be shared LAN to LAN as well as device to device.
